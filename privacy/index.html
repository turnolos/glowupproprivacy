        <p><strong>In Short:</strong> We process your information to provide, improve, and administer our Services, communicate with you, for security and fraud prevention, and to comply with law. We may also process your information for other purposes with your consent.</p>

        <p>We process your personal information for a variety of reasons, depending on how you interact with our Services, including:</p>

        </ul>

        <h2>3. WHAT LEGAL BASES DO WE RELY ON TO PROCESS YOUR INFORMATION?</h2>

        <p><strong>In Short:</strong> We only process your personal information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason (i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfill our contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfill our legitimate business interests.</p>

        <h2>4. WHEN AND WITH WHOM DO WE SHARE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h2>

        <p><strong>In Short:</strong> We may share information in specific situations described in this section and/or with the following categories of third parties.</p>

        <p>We may share your data with third-party vendors, service providers, contractors, or agents ("third parties") who perform services for us or on our behalf and require access to such information to do that work. These parties have access to your personal data only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.</p>

        <h2>5. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>

        <p>We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information.</p>

        <h2>6. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</h2>

If we learn that personal information from users less than 13 years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under age 13, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@glowuppro.ai">support@glowuppro.ai</a>.</p>

        <h2>7. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h2>

        <h2>8. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h2>

        <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track (“DNT”) feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online.</p>
