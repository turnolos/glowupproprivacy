    <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective Date: August 15, 2024</strong></p>
    
    <p>These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") govern your access and use of the GlowUpPro application (the "App"), provided by Sachin Marwaha ("we," "us," or "our"). By accessing or using the App, you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, you must immediately stop using the App and uninstall any copies in your possession.</p>

    <h2>1. Service Overview</h2>
    <p>GlowUpPro offers AI-based image generation services (the "Service"). To access the Service, users must purchase a subscription, which is required to use the app and to train AI models. Users may also purchase additional credits for generating images and extra model trainings through in-app purchases.</p>

    <h2>2. Purchases, Subscriptions, and Auto-Renewal</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Subscriptions:</strong> To use GlowUpPro, you are required to purchase a subscription, which grants you access to train and use AI models. The subscription will auto-renew unless you cancel it through your account in the App Store or Google Play.</li>
        <li><strong>In-App Purchases:</strong> You may purchase additional image generation credits and extra model trainings. Extra model trainings allow you to either train a new model or refine an existing one with different photos.</li>
        <li><strong>Pricing:</strong> Prices for subscriptions and in-app purchases will be clearly displayed within the App. By completing the purchase, you agree to pay all fees associated with the chosen plan.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Cancellation and Refund Policy</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Subscriptions:</strong> If you wish to cancel your subscription, you must do so through the App Store or Google Play. Uninstalling the App does not cancel your subscription. You will retain access to the Service until the end of the current billing cycle, but we do not provide refunds for unused portions of a subscription period.</li>
        <li><strong>In-App Purchases:</strong> All consumable in-app purchases, including image generation credits and extra model trainings, are final and non-refundable once they have been purchased.</li>
        <li><strong>Refund Requests:</strong> If you believe there has been an error with your purchase, you can contact us at <a href="mailto:support@glowuppro.ai">support@glowuppro.ai</a>. Refunds are at our sole discretion and will typically not be granted for consumable items, in line with industry standards.</li>
    </ul>
